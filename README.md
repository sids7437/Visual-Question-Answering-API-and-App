Visual Question Answering API and App using ViLT, Fast API, and Streamlit.


## To view your Streamlit app in a browser, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to your project directory where app.py is located.

3. Run the Streamlit app using the streamlit run command :
    streamlit run app.py


This will start a local server and provide you with a URL, typically something like "http://localhost:8501", which you can open in your web browser to interact with your Streamlit app.


## To Run FastAPI:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt

2. Run the FastAPI app using the FastAPI run command :
    uvicorn api:app --reload

3. Wait for Startup Confirmation:

    After running the uvicorn command, you should see output in your terminal confirming the server has started, typically on 'http://127.0.0.1:8000'.

4. Access Your Application:

    Open 'http://127.0.0.1:8000' in a web browser to interact with your FastAPI application.
