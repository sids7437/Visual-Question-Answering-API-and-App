# Visual-Question-Answering-API-and-App

Visual Question Answering API and App using ViLT, Fast API, and Streamlit.

## To view your Streamlit app in a browser, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to your project directory where app.py is located.

3. Run the Streamlit app using the streamlit run command:
    streamlit run app.py

This will start a local server and provide you with a URL, typically something like "http://localhost:8501", which you can open in your web browser to interact with your Streamlit app.
